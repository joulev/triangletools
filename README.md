# triangletools

This package aims to help you construct special points in a triangle directly in a short and easy way.

To install, download [this zip file](https://github.com/joulev/triangletools/files/10899848/test.zip) and extract it; there you should find all the relevant source code and a minimal working example. Then you can `\usepackage{triangletools}` to your heart's content. From there follow the documentation in the PDF file in this repository.

Because (1) I don't have TeX Live installed right now and (2) this package was only written for one of my friend so has quite bad API, I'm quite hesitant to upload it to CTAN. That's why you don't have it preinstalled in your LaTeX distribution. If you want me to publish the package to CTAN, feel free to open an issue.
